Artificial Intelligence
is branch of computer science that is concerned with building smart & intelligent machines
Machine Learning is a subset of AI
is a technique to implement AI that can learn from the data by themselves without being explicitly programmed
Deep Learning is a subset of ML
is a subfield of ML that uses a special type of algorithms called as Artifical Neural Networks to learn from the data


Supervised Learning is a type of ML
in Supervised Learning, the ML algorithem learns from Labelled Data
    we give the algorithm some picture of appels and label it as appel and some picture of mango and label it as mango the algorithem tries to find the patterns between these images when we make a picture of unanimous image the algo try to give with the patterns the name
Unsupervised Learning is a type of ML
in Unsupervised Learning, the ML algorithem learns from Unlabelled Data
    we give the algorithem some picture the algorithem find the pattern and it tries to group these picture and when we give a new image the algo class this new picture in a group
Reinforcement Learning is a type of ML
is an area of machine learning concerned with how intelligent agents take actions in an envirenment to maximize its rewards (Environment, Agent, Action, Reward)

Classification is a type of Supervised Learning
is about predicting a class or discrete values, male/female, appel/mango, true/false ...
Regression is a type of Supervised Learning
is about predicting a quantity or continuous values, age, salary, price ...

Decision Tree Classification is a type of Classification
Random Forest Classification is a type of Classification
K-nearest Neighbor is a type of Classification

Logistic Regression is type of Regression
Polynomial Regression is type of Regression
Support Vector Machines is type of Regression

Clustering is a type of Unsupervised Learning
is an unsupervised task which involves grouping the similar data points
Association is a type of Unsupervised Learning
is an unsupervised task that used to find important relationship between data points

ML
Input -> Features extraction by humain -> classification -> Output

DL
Input -> Features extraction automatically -> classification -> Output
