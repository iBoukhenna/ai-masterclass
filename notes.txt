Artificial Intelligence
is branch of computer science that is concerned with building smart & intelligent machines
Machine Learning is a subset of AI
is a technique to implement AI that can learn from the data by themselves without being explicitly programmed
Deep Learning is a subset of ML
is a subfield of ML that uses a special type of algorithms called as Artifical Neural Networks to learn from the data


Supervised Learning is a type of ML
in Supervised Learning, the ML algorithem learns from Labelled Data
    we give the algorithm some picture of appels and label it as appel and some picture of mango and label it as mango the algorithem tries to find the patterns between these images when we make a picture of unanimous image the algo try to give with the patterns the name
Unsupervised Learning is a type of ML
in Unsupervised Learning, the ML algorithem learns from Unlabelled Data
    we give the algorithem some picture the algorithem find the pattern and it tries to group these picture and when we give a new image the algo class this new picture in a group
Reinforcement Learning is a type of ML
is an area of machine learning concerned with how intelligent agents take actions in an envirenment to maximize its rewards (Environment, Agent, Action, Reward)

Classification is a type of Supervised Learning
is about predicting a class or discrete values, male/female, appel/mango, true/false ...
Regression is a type of Supervised Learning
is about predicting a quantity or continuous values, age, salary, price ...

Decision Tree Classification is a type of Classification
Random Forest Classification is a type of Classification
K-nearest Neighbor is a type of Classification

Logistic Regression is type of Regression
Polynomial Regression is type of Regression
Support Vector Machines is type of Regression

Clustering is a type of Unsupervised Learning
is an unsupervised task which involves grouping the similar data points
Association is a type of Unsupervised Learning
is an unsupervised task that used to find important relationship between data points

ML
Input -> Features extraction by humain -> classification -> Output

DL
Input -> Features extraction automatically -> classification -> Output

Where to collect the Data? 
    Kaggle
    UCI Machine Learning Repository
    Google Dataset Search

ML Project Work Flow
   Data
-> Data pre processing (eg. handle missing values)
-> Data Analysis (eg. find which columns feature is important for the prediction)
-> Train Test Split (Split data into training data and testing data)
-> Machine Learning Model (feed the training data to ML model to find pattern)
-> Evaluation (Evaluate the model using the test data)

Handling Missing Values : replace by mean (average), median (central), mode (more repeated) 

Data Standardization : make all the data to a common format and common range

Label Encoding : converting the labels into numeric form

Train Test Split : splitting the data into training data and test data

Handle Imbalanced Data : building a dataset containing similar distribution of different

Feature Extraction : the mapping from textual data to real valued vwctor is called feature extraction
    1. Bag Of Words (BOW) : list of unique words in the text corpus
    2. Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) : To count the number of times each word appears in a document
        Term Frequency (TF) : Number of times term t appears in a document / Number of terms in the document
        Inverse Docuement Frequency (IDF) : log(N/n), where, N is the number of documents and n is the number of documents a term t has appeared in
        The IDF value of a rare word is high whereas the IDF of a frequent word is low
            TF-IDF value of term = TF * IDF

Stemming  : is the process of reducing a word to its keyword (Root word)

5.1 Linear Algebra
    Vectors
        Speed = 50 km/hr (Scalar Quantity)
        Velocity = 50 km/hr North (Vector Quantity)

        Vector have : Vector : (2, 2) or 2i + 2j
            1. Magnitude = sqr(exp(x1, 2),exp(x2, 2)) = sqr(exp(2,2) + exp(2,2)) = sqr(4+4) = sqr(8)
            2. Direction = tan (a) = 2/2 = 1 (a = $%)
        
        Vector Addition = (2,3) + (3,-2) = (5,1)
        Vector Subtraction = (2,3) + (3,-2) = (-1,5)
        Multiplying a Vector by Scalar = (2,3) * 2 = (4,6)
        Multiplying a Vector by Scalar = (2,3) * -0.5 = (-1,-1.5)
        Angle between 2 Vectors :
            Inference : 
                If the angle between 2 vectors is small then the 2 vectors are similar
                If the angle between 2 vectors is large then the 2 vectors are very different
