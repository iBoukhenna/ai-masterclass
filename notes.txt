    Types of Statistical Studies
        Sample Study :
        is a study which is carried out an a sample which represents the total population
        Observational Study
        is study where we simply collect and analyze data we won't inject any changes we just observe the correlation in the data
        Experimental Study
        is study in which conditions are controlled and manipulated by the experimenter
5.2.5.Population & Sample
    Population & Sample
    a sample study is a study which is carried out an a sample which represents the total population
        Sampling Techniques
            (Probability Sampling Techniques)
                Simple Random Sampling
                    the sample is randomly picked from a larger population hence all the individual datapoint has an equal probability to be selected as sample data
                    eg. employee survey in a company
                    Pros: 
                    No sample Bis
                    Balanced Sample
                    Simple Methode of Sampling
                    Requires less domain knowledge
                    Cons:
                    Population size should be high
                    Cannot represend the population well sometimes
                Systematic Sampling
                    the sample is picked from the population at regular intervals, this type of sampling is carried out if the poplation is homogeneous and the data points are uniformly distributed
                    eg. selecting every 10th member from a population of 10000
                    Pros:
                    Quick & easy
                    Less Bias
                    Even distribution of data
                    Cons:
                    Data manipulation risk
                    Requires randomness in data
                    Population should not have patterns
                Stratified Random Sampling
                    the population is subdivided into smaller groups called Strata, Samples are obtained randomly from all these strata
                    eg. Smarthphone sales in all the states
                    Props:
                    Finds important characteristics in the population
                    High precision can be obtained in the differences in the strata in high
                    Cons:
                    Cannot be performed on populations that cannot be classified into groups
                    Overlapping data points
                Cluster Sampling
                    is carried out on population that has inherent groups , this population is subdivided into clusters and then random are taken as sample
                    eg. Smartphone sales in randomly selected states
                    Pros:
                    Requires only fewer resources
                    Reduced Variability
                    Advantages of both Random sampling and Stratified sampling
                    Cons:
                    Cannot be performed on populations without natural groups
                    Overlapping data points
                    Can't provide a general insight for the entire population
            (Non-Probability Sampling Techniques)
                ...
5.2.6.Central Tendencies
    Central Tendency
    a measure of central tendency is a value that represents the center point or typical value of a dataset, it is a value that summarizes the data
        Mean (avrage) : is the sum of values divided by the number of values
            eg. [160,172,165,168,174], mean = (160+172+165+168+174)/5 = 167.8
        Median : is the middle value in the list of numbers, To find the median , the nubers have to be listed in numerical order from smallest to largest
            eg. [160,172,165,168,174], median = [160,165,168,172,174] = 168
            eg. [160,172,165,168,174,176], median = [160,165,168,172,174,176] = (168+172)/2 = 170
        Mode : is the value that occurs most often if no number in the list is repeated the there is no mode for the list
            eg. [160,172,165,168,174], mode = there is no mode for the list
            eg. [160,172,160,168,174], mode = 160
        Central Tendencies in Data Pre-Processing : are very useful in handling the missing values in a dataset
            mean : missing values in a dataset can be replaced with mean value if the data is uniformly distributed
            median : missing values in a dataset can be replaced with median value if the data is skewed
            mode : missing values in a dataset can be replaced with mode value if the data is skewed, missing categorical values can also be replaced with mode value
5.2.7.Range Sample Variance & Standard Deviation
    Measure of Variability
        Range : is the diffrence between the largest and smallest values it can give a rough idea about the distribution of our dataset
            eg. [-5,0,5,10,15], mean = 5, range = 15 - (-5) = 20
            eg. [3,4,5,6,7], mean = 5, range = 7 - 3 = 4
        Variance : is a measure of how far each number in the set is from the mean and therefore from every other number is the dataset
            eg. [-5,0,5,10,15], mean = 5, variance = exp((-5-5),2)+exp((0-5),2)+exp((5-5),2)+exp((10-5),2)+exp((15-5),2) / 5 = 50
            eg. [3,4,5,6,7], mean = 5, variance = exp((3-5),2)+exp((4-5),2)+exp((5-5),2)+exp((6-5),2)+exp((7-5),2) / 5 = 2
        Standard Deviation : is the sqaure root of variance. it looks at how spread out a group of numbers is from the mean
            eg. [-5,0,5,10,15], mean = 5, SD = sqrt(variance) = sqrt(50) = 7.1
            eg. [3,4,5,6,7], mean = 5, SD = sqrt(variance) = sqrt(2) = 1.4    
5.2.8.Percentiles & Dispersion
    Percentiles and Quantiles
        Percentiles : is a value on scale of 100 that indicates the percent of a distribution is equal to or below it
        eg. Dataset with height of 15 people, range [160,180], median = 170 is 50th Percentile, 
        Quantiles : is a measure that tells how many values in a dataset are above or below a certain limit it divides the members of the dataset into equally-sized subgroups
        eg. Dataset with height of 15 people, range [160,180], median = 170 is 0.5 or 50% Quantile, 
5.2.9.Correlation & Causation
    Correlation and Causation
        Correlation : is a measure that determines the extent to which two variables are related to each other in a dataset, But it doesn't mean that one event is the cause of the other event
            Positive Correlation : if one value increase the other value increase
            eg. house price and number of rooms
            Negative Correlation : if one value increase the other value decrease
            eg. house price and crime rate
        Causation : means that one event causes another event to occur thus there is a cause and effect relationship between two variables in a dataset
            eg. Ice cream sales and temperature
5.2.10.Hypothesis Testing
    Hypothesis : is an assumption that is made based on the observation of an experiment
        Null Hypothesis : H0 is the commonly accepted fact
        eg. Ptolemy proposed that sun, stars and other planets revolve around the earth
        Alternative Hypothesis : Ha is opposite to null hypothesis and it challenges the null hypothesis
        eg. Aryabhata proposed that earth and other planets revolve around the sun
    Hypothesis Testing : is an method carried out to tests the assumptions made in the experiment
        eg. Pharmaceutical company, headace, time taken for recovery in minutes
        drug1 for group1 : [12, 8, 13, 10, 7] = average = 10 minutes
        drug2 for group2 : [15, 12, 18, 16, 14] = average = 15 minutes
        Null Hypothesis H0 Drug1 is more quicker than drug2
        Alternative Hypothesis Ha drug2 is more quicker than drug1
        Possible Outcomes of Hypothesis Testing : 
            Reject the Null Hypothesis
            Faik to reject the Null Hypothesis

    eg. what is the probability of getting a number less than 10 when we roll a die = 1
    Probability Value :
        impossible = 0, 0%
        half chance = 0.5, 50%, 1/2
        certain = 1, 100%
    Probability of an event to occur = Number of ways an event can occur / Total number of outcomes
        eg. Toss a coin = Possible Outcomes (H,T) = P(H) = 1/2 = P(T) = 1/2
        eg. Roll a dice = Possible Outcomes (1,2,3,4,5,6) = P(5) = 1/6 = 0.16
        eg. Roll a dice = Possible Outcomes (1,2,3,4,5,6) = P(even) = 3/6 = 0.5    
5.3.3. Random Variables and its types | Discrete Random Variables | Continuous Random Variables

    Normal Distribution or Gaussian Distribution
    Skewness : a data is considered skewed when the distribution curve appear distored or skewed either to the left or to the right in a statistical distribution
    Negatively skewed : Mean, Median, Mode
    Normal or no skew : Mean=Median=Mode
    Positively skewed : Mode, Median, Mean
5.3.6. Poisson Distribution
    Poisson Distribution is a probability distribution that measures how many times an event is likely to occur within a specified period of time
    Poisson Distribution is used to understand independent events that occur at a contant rate within a given interval of time
    eg. Number of accidents occurring in a city from 6pm to 10pm
    eg. Number of Patients arriving in an Emergency Room between 10pm to 12pm
    eg. How may viens does your blog gets in a day
    x -> number of times the event occurs
    P(x) -> probability
    L -> Mean number of event
    x! -> Factorial of x
    e -> Euler's Number (2.71828)
